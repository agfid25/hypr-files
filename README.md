### My Hyprland rices

As I work on ricing my own machine, I will add my dotfiles here.
Feel free to download and use them, but never steal the credit: if you use it and show it to people, say where it came from.

#### First
_First_ is literally what it is called: it is my first rice. It is very simple. It is coloured in blue, and is meant to look simple and work simply as well. It shows tabs on the left, system info on the right, and the current app title in the centre. Keyboard control is a must here, and I added a few programs to _SUPER + KEY_. I plan to add a few more as needed.

#### Classic

_Classic_ is a rice I created to make the computer look as if it were an old Apple II or DOS machine. It is built on top of _First_, so additions to _First_ are still in this one.
